## Tree regression

Just an insight on how decision trees could work in our case. This is for the data average on a semi-hourly basis.

## Partial dependence

With the set of graphs below, we can already spot some correlations. *x-axis* is the feature considered, *y-axis* is the number of calls.

On Mondays, the average number of calls is sligthly higher, whereas it's lower on Saturdays, and even worse on Sundays.
